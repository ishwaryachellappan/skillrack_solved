 The function/method customToUpper accepts three arguments str, fromChar and to Char representing a string and two lower case alphabets respectively. 

The function/method customToUpper must modify the string str by converting the lower case alphabets that occur between from Char and toChat in the English alphabet set(both inclusive) to upper case. 

Your task is to implement the function customToUpper so that it passes all the test cases: 

Note: The fromChar always occurs before the toChar in the English alphabet set. 

IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined.



 Example Input/Output 1:

Input:

Skill Rack

hp

Output:

Modified String: SKILLRack

Explanation

In the given string S, the lower case alphabets that occur from h to pare killand k After converting the above lower case alphabets to upper case, the string becomes SKILLRack

Example Input/Output 2:

input:

MicTesting One Two Three

am

Output

Modified String: MICTEstinG Ont=TwoWTHREE
